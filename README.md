# nft-transaction-system
Motivated by the recent popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs1
), I would like to set up a local shop that can buy/sell NFTs for investors in Dallas based on Ethereum blockchain2.
Now I have to develop a web based NFT trading application. In particular,
to create convenient and easy-to-use software for NFT traders who are trying to
buy and sell NFTs. To help myself, I have to develop a web based software system called
NTS (NFT Transaction System) that leverage the relational DBMS technology for data storage
and querying. 


# Getting Started

### Installations


1.Install Node
2.Install Mysql
3.Install java JDK 8.0
4.vs code

### Guides
The following guides illustrate how to start the application:

1.Clone/Unzip the repository
2.run the backend by opening the folder NTS-Backend in vs code 
3.open the forntend in another window
4.execute "npm install"
5.execute "npm start"

P.S: The dummy data will be reloaded everytime we restart the backend!
